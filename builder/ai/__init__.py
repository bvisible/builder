# Builder AI Module
# Provides AI-powered creative generation for Frappe Builder pages
#
# This module implements direct LLM generation with full creative freedom.
# The AI generates unique, context-adapted websites while respecting
# the FrappeBlock JSON format.
#
# NOTHING is imported eagerly here, on purpose.
#
# This package used to pull its own submodules at import time — providers,
# generators, validators. Every one of them imports `builder.ai.logging`,
# which re-enters this file, which is halfway through importing providers. A
# single-threaded import survives that by luck of ordering; two requests
# importing at once do not, and Python raises either
#
#     ImportError: cannot import name 'get_provider' from partially
#     initialized module 'builder.ai.providers' (circular import)
#
# or, from the other thread, `_frozen_importlib._DeadlockError`.
#
# It showed as the AI settings panel announcing "CLI not installed" for a CLI
# that was installed and paired: the first two calls after a restart raced each
# other, both failed, and the screen believed the empty answer.
#
# `__getattr__` (PEP 562) keeps the same public surface while importing each
# name only when someone asks for it, by which time the package is fully
# initialised.
