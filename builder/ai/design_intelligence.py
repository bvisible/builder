"""Design intelligence: professional candidates for the design brief.

Queries the vendored UI/UX Pro Max database (see design_data/README.md) with
BM25 and returns a prompt-ready CANDIDATES block: UI styles, product-aligned
color palettes, typography pairings and UX anti-patterns matched to the
business. The brief LLM picks and adapts — candidates widen its taste, they
never replace its judgment.

Best-effort by design: any failure returns None and the brief generates
exactly as before.
