"""Writing blog articles for a site the generator already knows.

The point is not "an LLM can write a blog post" — anything can. It is that this
one writes for *this* site: the same business, the same tone the design brief
settled on, and with the pages that already exist available to link to. An
article that could have been written for any site is the thing nobody wants.

So the context comes from what the site already carries:

- the chrome config for the site's name and what it says about itself;
- the saved design brief for the tone that was decided once;
- the published pages, so the article can point at them instead of inventing
  a "contact us" that goes nowhere.

What makes an article worth publishing:

- It says something only this business could say. Their trade, their region,
  their way of working. Generic advice that fits any business in the sector is
  the failure mode to avoid.
- It is useful on its own. A reader who never buys anything should still come
  away with something.
- It is the length the subject deserves — usually 400 to 700 words. Padding to
  hit a number reads as padding.
- It sounds like a person who does this work, not like marketing copy. No
  "In today's fast-paced world", no "Look no further", no closing paragraph
  that summarises what was just said.

Write in the language of the brief you are given. Return Markdown starting at
'## ' — the title is rendered separately, so an H1 in the body duplicates it."""
