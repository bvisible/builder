"""
Codex CLI provider — text and structured generation through a ChatGPT plan.

Why: `codex exec` runs the agent headlessly against the machine's Codex login
(a ChatGPT Plus/Pro session), so generation costs subscription usage instead of
metered API tokens. It also speaks JSON Schema natively (`--output-schema`),
which is exactly the contract our generators need.

SECURITY — read before touching this file. Codex is an *agent*: by design it
can run shell commands. Our prompts carry text that came from an LLM or from a
client's WordPress site, so a prompt injection could try to make it act. Every
invocation therefore:
  * runs with `--sandbox read-only` (text) — no writes anywhere;
  * runs `--ephemeral` (no session files) and `--skip-git-repo-check`;
  * passes the prompt on **stdin**, never through a shell (argv list, no
    shell=True), so nothing can be interpolated into a command line;
  * runs inside a dedicated empty working directory;
  * is killed on a hard timeout.
Never add `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` here.

Images are the one exception, and a narrow one: drawing needs a writable
directory, so they run `--sandbox workspace-write` — and, where that sandbox
cannot start at all, `danger-full-access`. That only happens inside a
container, whose own boundary is stricter than the one we gave up. It is still
a widening: the working directory is a throwaway that holds nothing but the
generated file, and it is deleted when the call returns.

SCOPE — a ChatGPT plan is nominative. This provider is meant for a self-hosted
Studio driven by its own owner (or our own dogfooding), not as a shared backend
serving third parties.
