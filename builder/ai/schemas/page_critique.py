#//// Neoffice — added file (no upstream equivalent): pydantic shape of the visual critique a vision
#//// model returns. builder/ai/** = the Neoffice AI site generator; frappe/builder ships no such
#//// module. First commit 631deed3 2026-06-23.
"""
Schema for the visual verification loop.

A vision model looks at a SCREENSHOT of a generated page and reports concrete,
visible problems so the generator can fix them — the "the LLM sees what it made"
loop. Kept deliberately small so smaller vision models can fill it reliably.
