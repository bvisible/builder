#//// Neoffice — added file (no upstream equivalent): the site logo in one place, so the Theme tab and
#//// the AI chat write to the same spot. Neoffice-only; frappe/builder has no site-chrome subsystem.
#//// First commit e4d8ef41 2026-08-03.
# The site logo, in one place.
#
# A logo can arrive from two doors — the Theme tab, or dropped into the AI chat
# — and both must land in the same spot: the site chrome that every page
# renders. Anything else means a client uploads their logo to the assistant and
# their site keeps showing someone else's.
#
# STABLE PATH. The file is always written to /files/logo-default.png, whatever
# the uploaded file was called. A managed fleet references that one path across
# every instance (provisioning drops a per-client file there), so a new upload
# has to REPLACE the bytes, never mint a new URL. The rendered <img> carries a
# ?v= token derived from the content so browsers still see the change.
