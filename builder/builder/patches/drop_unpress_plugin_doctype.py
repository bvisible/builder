# //// Neoffice — added file (no upstream equivalent): renames the Unpress-branded plugin doctype to
# //// Website Plugin. Neoffice migration, listed in patches.txt; frappe/builder has no equivalent. First
# //// commit 45e67b23 2026-08-04.
# The plugin registry and the chrome Web Templates were briefly named after the
# Unpress edition before they shipped.
#
# It is the same subsystem in both editions, and Neoffice must not carry Unpress
# branding in a doctype name a client can see — the mirror of the rule that
# keeps Neoffice out of the open-source project. Renamed to "Website Plugin",
# matching Website Header Footer Config next to it.
#
# The registry is derived: sync_plugins() rebuilds every row from the manifest
# on the next migrate, so the old table can go without carrying anything over
# except the one thing the site chose — whether each plugin is on.
