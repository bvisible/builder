#//// Neoffice — added file (no upstream equivalent): repairs root blocks the generator wrote without
#//// originalElement. Neoffice migration, listed in patches.txt; frappe/builder has no equivalent.
#//// First commit dfb3c900 2026-08-03.
# Repair the root block of pages generated before the editor could recognise it.
#
# The generator wrote the root as {"element": "body"} without `originalElement`,
# which is what Block.isRoot() tests. The body was therefore treated as an
# ordinary block: the resize handle appeared on it, and a single drag wrote a
# fixed pixel width — which the page then carried into its published CSS,
# leaving the site narrower than the viewport with a horizontal overflow.
#
# This stamps `originalElement` on the roots that lack it, and drops a fixed
# pixel width from the root's styles. A root width in % or a keyword is left
# alone: only an absolute px value can produce the overflow.
