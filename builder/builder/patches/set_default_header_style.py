# //// Neoffice — added file (no upstream equivalent): writes the header style down on configs that
# //// predate the field. Neoffice migration, listed in patches.txt; frappe/builder has no equivalent.
# //// First commit 07101da2 2026-08-03.
# Give existing sites a header style.
#
# The field arrived after these configs were created, so they carry no value
# and the Theme tab shows an empty "Select option". The renderer already falls
# back to Classic, which is exactly what these sites look like today — this
# only writes down what is already true.
#
# The site-wide config is a Single (its values live in `tabSingles`, it has no
# table of its own); the per-profile Variant is an ordinary doctype. Going
# through the ORM handles both without caring which is which.
