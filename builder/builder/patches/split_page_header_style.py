# //// Neoffice — added file (no upstream equivalent): splits page_header_style into a preset and a fill,
# //// carrying each site's choice over. Neoffice migration, listed in patches.txt; frappe/builder has no
# //// equivalent. First commit d6ed4130 2026-08-05.
# The band's single enum becomes a preset and a fill.
#
# `page_header_style` mixed a composition with a background: "Centered" is an
# alignment, "Tinted" is what the band sits on. A site could therefore never ask
# for a centred title over a photograph — half the combinations had no way of
# being said. The field is split, and what each site already chose is carried
# across rather than reset to the default.
#
# Read before writing: the old column is dropped by `bench migrate` once the
# doctype no longer declares it, so this has to run while it is still there.

	A site generated before the shared band exists carries its opening inside

	live client site: /about opened on "À PROPOS / Daniel Moret Info Service"
	and the band would have added "Accueil / À propos" over it.

	So the band defaults to off wherever the pages already speak for themselves.
	Turning it on stays one setting away, once those openings have been lifted.
