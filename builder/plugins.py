"""The plugin registry.

Frappe has no notion of "installed but off". `frappe.get_hooks()` is
unconditional: the moment an app is in `installed_apps`, its hooks, routes,
assets and doctypes are live, and the only real switch — `bench uninstall-app`
— **drops the module's tables**. That is the wrong trade for a site owner who
just wants to hide a feature: turning the blog off should not delete the
articles.

So a plugin here is not an install. It is a row that says *this capability
exists on this bench, and the owner wants it on or off*. Turning it off:

- hides its entry in the Studio (`get_capabilities` feeds the `v-if`);
- refuses its whitelisted endpoints (`guard`);
- 404s the web routes it owns (`route_guard`, wired to `before_request`).

What it deliberately does NOT do is unload hooks or drop data. A disabled
plugin is dormant, not gone, and turning it back on is instant.

This is also the seam the community store will plug into: a hub-installed
plugin is the same row with `source = "Hub"`.
