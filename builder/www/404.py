"""The page a visitor lands on when the address is wrong — or not built yet.

Frappe's own 404 blocks the navbar and the footer, so it arrives as a bare
sentence on a grey field: the visitor loses the site at the exact moment they
need a way back into it.

It also cannot tell apart the two things that produce a 404 on a young site.
One is a wrong address. The other is a link the site deliberately carries for a
section that is coming — the shop menu on an Unpress site, which the generator
writes because the site will have one. That second case deserves a different
sentence and no apology.
